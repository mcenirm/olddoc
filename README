= olddoc - old-fashioned Ruby documentation generator

olddoc contains old-fashioned document generators for those who do not
wish to impose bloated, new-fangled web cruft on their readers.

olddoc contains oldweb, an HTML generator without any images, frames,
CSS, or JavaScript.  It is designed for users of text-based browsers
and/or low-bandwidth connections.  oldweb focuses on text as it is
the lowest common denominator for accessibility and compatibility
with people and hardware.

== Reasons

* No CSS.  Encouraging users to use CSS leads to problems like
  copy-paste hijacking: http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste
  External CSS also increases page load time as it often blocks page
  rendering.  Asynchronous loading of CSS also causes accessibility
  problems as links/buttons may move as a user attempts to click.

* No JavaScript.  There is a constant barrage of security and
  client-side performance problems associated with it.  It's also
  unreasonable to expect users to rely on LibreJS and inspect every
  piece of JS they run.

* No frames.  Frames are an accessibility hassle and unfriendly
  to users of tiny screens on mobile devices and text-based browsers.

* No images.  Not everyone can view or afford bandwidth to load images.
  This also reduces the potential for security vulnerabilities as less
  code gets run.  Furthermore, loading the wrong image in a public
  place can get you arrested (or worse).

Encourage readers to simplify and speed up their browsing experience.
They can disable CSS, JavaScript, and images in their browser without
missing out!

== Usage

	gem install olddoc
	cd $ANY_RDOC_USING_RUBY_PROJECT
	rdoc -f oldweb

You can also use olddoc to generate NEWS entries
assuming you have git tags, a README file and .olddoc.yml

	olddoc prepare

And "olddoc merge" to merge instances of "olddoc_placeholder" in
an HTML file with HTML fragments generated with other tools
such as pandoc(1).  This requries an appropriately configured
.olddoc.yml with a "merge_html" section see olddoc(5)

== Source code

	git clone git://80x24.org/olddoc
