# NAME

.olddoc.yml - olddoc config file format

# SYNOPSIS

A YAML file in the top-level project directory named ".olddoc.yml"

# DESCRIPTION

As olddoc favors consistency over configuration, there is minimal
configuration to deal with.

# KEYS

`rdoc_url`, `cgit_url` should be obvious

`merge_html` is a key-value mapping of (empty) RDoc source files to an
HTML file that will be merged into RDoc after-the-fact.  It is useful
for merging non-RDoc generated HTML into the project.
